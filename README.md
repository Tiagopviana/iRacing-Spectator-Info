# iRacing-Spectator-Info
Simhub overlay, for iRacing.

Small overlay to add more info of the driver you are spectating.
-  Race type logo + Safety Rating + iRating (design inspired by iRacing UI)
-  Position in session with total drivers (in single brand race, the color will be the license. In multiclass, the color will be the class color)
-  Tyre compound
-  Best lap and difference to best 
-  Car Logo
-  Club Logo

Inspiration for the redesign:

Note1: The overlay will deactivate once you are driving and when you are spectating yourself (will be over you wheel...).

For this overlay to work, you need, in Simhub, to activate "Forced visible"

Known Problems:
-  Some car logos don't work. Still looking on that.
-  Probably some flags don't work. Couldn't test all...
-  Overlay will be active if you hide iRacing UI (space key).
-  Best lap gap, in a multi class race, will be to the fastest of all classes... Simhub doesn't give other option...
