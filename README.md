# iRacing-Spectator-Info
Simhub overlay, for iRacing.

Small overlay to add more info of the driver you are spectating. 
-  Position in session with total drivers (Base color will be the Class)
-  Best lap and difference to best (Base color will be the Class)
-  iRating
-  Safety Rating
-  Car Logo
-  Club Logo

Note1: The overlay will deactivate once you are driving and when you are spectating yourself (will be over you wheel...).


For this overlay to work, you need, in Simhub, to activate "Forced visible"

Known Problems:
-  Some car logos don't work. Still looking on that.
-  Probably some flags don't work. Couldn't test all...
-  Overlay will be active if you hide iRacing UI (space key).

Note2: If you find useful and found an error, or you have some suggestions, feel free to ask!
